Makers Academy have requested the following basic functionality in the
'Chitter' app:

1 As a Maker
  So that I can let people know what I am doing
  I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

2 As a maker
  So that I can see what others are saying
  I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

3 As a Maker
  So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
  I want to see the time at which it was made

4 As a Maker
  So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
  I want to sign up for Chitter


They would also like to see the following implemented if possible:

5 As a Maker
  So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
  I want to log in to Chitter

6 As a Maker
  So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
  I want to log out of Chitter


7 As a Maker
  So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
  I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
